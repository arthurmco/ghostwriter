# Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter is a software for those that want a platform for article/blog 
editing and management, but don't want a predefined way to display it, 
with limited choice for themes, complicated APIs and a difficult configuration

This software gives *you* the control of how the posts are shown, offering
a simple REST API for creating and showing them, along a simple interface 
for managing them. We don't offer a way to show them, we let you do it at
your way.
